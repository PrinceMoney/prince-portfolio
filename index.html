    <h1>About Pince Money</h1>
    <P>My name is Prince Money,I am 18 years of age ,average in height and also brown skinned.
      I am a native of Ogoni,khana local government in Rivers State but based in port harcourt.
      I am the first and only male child out of three children my parents got,I practice christianity and also a graduate of the secondary educational level in federal republic of nigeria.
      There were so many experiences in my primary and secondary school days.I went to so many schools as a result of changing or moving to a new area of living.
      Although all the school I went to was fun and had intelligent, good teachers with discipline,I myself was fully involved in school activities and that was how i got to know my best friends kingsley okoro and ijeoma sparkle.They are very intelligent they sometimes teach things i don't understand in science class back then in school.we were given prefect from ss2 but unfortunately not all graduated from adonai best educational center kingsley left us because at that time he could no longer afford the school fees.

      </P>
